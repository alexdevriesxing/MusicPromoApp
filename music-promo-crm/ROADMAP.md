# Music Promo CRM â€” Desktop Roadmap (Locked)

This roadmap defines a focused set of milestones to deliver a fully built desktop app (Tauri) without any Gemini/AI features. No features beyond this list will be added. All milestones are locked and start unchecked.

How to proceed:
- Say "Implement Milestone X" to request implementation for milestone X.
- After implementation, the milestone will be checked off and marked done here.
